# Homebridge DACP Plugin

This plugin enables Homebridge to control devices or programs, which implement [DACP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Audio_Control_Protocol). Examples of programs or
devices that can be controlled by this plugin are Apple TV and iTunes.

This plugin runs on any system capable of running [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge)
and only needs network access to the device or program in question. There is no need to
run this on the same machine as iTunes.

This plugin provides volume control and play/pause controls via HomeKit. These can be
used in conjunction with the [homebridge-callmonitor plugin](https://github.com/grover/homebridge-callmonitor)
to pause media playback or to reduce the playback volume while on a phone call.

The Speaker service, which provides volume control and mute, can be disabled if it is not
required - for example if the Apple TV is connected to an A/V receiver that is integrated with HomeKit via a different plugin.

## Installation instructions

After [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) has been installed:

 `sudo npm install -g homebridge-dacp`

## Example config.json

```json
{
  "bridge": {
      ...
  },
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "DACP",
      "devices": [
        {
          "name": "Apple TV (Living room)",
          "pairing": "...pairing code...",
          "serviceName": "...service name...",
        },
        {
          "name": "iTunes on iMac",
          "pairing": "...pairing code...",
          "serviceName": "...service name..."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The platform can connect to any number of devices or programs at the same time as long as they support the DACP protocol. I've tested the plugin with an Apple TV 4 and iTunes 12.7.

You may choose to create multiple remote controls: One per device/program that you'd like to control. The name of the remote control is also the name of the accessory in HomeKit.

The plugin is configured with the following configuration:

| Attributes | Usage |
|------------|-------|
| name | The name of the accessory and remote control to create for this device. |
| pairing | The pairing code for the device, which is created during the pairing process. |
| serviceName | The service name obtained during the pairing process. |
| features | An object that enables you to restrict the services created for this accessory. |
| no-volume-control | Disables the Speaker service for Apple TVs, which perform volume control through external devices like a TV or A/V receiver. |

## Accessory Services

Each device will expose multiple services:

* Accessory Information Service
* Speaker Service
* [Player Controls Service](src/hap/PlayerControlsTypes.js)
* [Now Playing Service](src/hap/NowPlayingTypes.js)

### Player Controls Service

This service provides status information about the currently playing media. This contains
the following fields:

| Characteristic | UUID | Type | Permissions | Description |
|----------------|------|------|-------------|-------------|
| PlayPause | `BA16B86C-DC86-482A-A70C-CC9C924DB842` | Boolean | Read, Write, Notify | Represents the playback state of the device/iTunes. |


### Now Playing Service

This service provides status information about the currently playing media. This contains
the following fields:

| Characteristic | UUID | Type | Permissions | Description |
|----------------|------|------|-------------|-------------|
| Title | `00003001-0000-1000-8000-135D67EC4377` | String | Read, Notify | The title of the currently playing track. |
| Album | `00003002-0000-1000-8000-135D67EC4377` | String | Read, Notify | The album of the currently playing track. |
| Artist | `00003003-0000-1000-8000-135D67EC4377` | String | Read, Notify | The artist of the currently playing track. |
| Position | `00002007-0000-1000-8000-135D67EC4377` | String | Read, Notify | The current playback position. |
| Duration | `00003005-0000-1000-8000-135D67EC4377` | String | Read, Notify | The duration of the current track. |

## Supported clients

This platform and the devices it controls have been verified to work with the following apps on iOS 11

* Elgato Eve

## Supported devices and programs

* Apple TV 4
* Apple iTunes 12.7

Other devices not listed here may work. If you have another device that works, please report
it via a [GitHub](https://github.com/grover/homebridge-dacp/issues) issue.

### Pairing

The remote controls created by this plugin need to be paired to the devices/programs you want to use. Generally one starts out by defining
the remote control in the configuration file:

```json
"platforms": [
  {
    "platform": "DACP",
    "devices": [
      {
        "name": "New Remote Control"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

It is important to leave out the `pairing` and `serviceName` fields of the remote. When you launch `homebridge` with this configuration, a log similar to the following will be displayed:

```text
[DACP] Found device in config: "New Remote Control"
[DACP]
[DACP] Beginning "New Remote Control" remote control announcements for the device.
[DACP]
[DACP] Skipping creation of the accessory because it doesn't have a pairing code or service name yet.
[DACP] You need to pair the device/iTunes, reconfigure and restart homebridge.
[DACP]
[DACP] 	Use passcode 7118 to pair with this remote control.
[DACP]
```

The plugin is advertising the new remote control for pairing and can be
paired using the passcode printed.

The further pairing process varies by device or program and the following sections describe these and configuration specialties specifically.

#### Pairing Apple TV to a homebridge-dacp remote control

Apple has provided a [support page](https://support.apple.com/de-de/HT201664), which describes the process to pair Apple TV to the iOS Remote App. The process is identical for this plugin.

It is recommended to disable the volume controls for Apple TVs as the device itself is not managing the audio playback. That is usually the
purpose of the TV set or a dedicated A/V receiver. Use plugins for those
to control the volume, if possible.

#### Pairing Apple iTunes to a homebridge-dacp remote control

Apple has provided a [support page](https://support.apple.com/kb/ph19503), which describes the process to pair Apple iTunes to the iOS Remote App. The process is identical for this plugin.

### Once pairing has completed

After you've paired the product in question to this plugin the following output will be shown:

```text
[DACP] Added pairing for "New Remote Control":
[DACP] 
[DACP] {
[DACP]   "name": "New Remote Control",
[DACP]   "pairing": "16BC60A46299FEC4",
[DACP]   "serviceName": "AEA342CEA7A8E7EE"
[DACP] }
[DACP] 
[DACP] Please add the above block to the remote in your homebridge config.json.
[DACP]
[DACP] YOU MUST RESTART HOMEBRIDGE AFTER YOU ADDED THE ABOVE LINES OR THE PLUGIN WILL NOT WORK.
[DACP]
```

Insert the `pairing` and `serviceName` fields in the respective remote
in your config.json and restart homebridge for the changes to take effect.

After the restart the plugin should be useable.
