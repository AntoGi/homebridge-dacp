# Homebridge DACP Plugin

_This is still work in progress._

This plugin enables Homebridge to control devices or programs, which implement [DACP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Audio_Control_Protocol). Examples of programs or
devices that can be controlled by this plugin are Apple TV and iTunes.

This plugin runs on any system capable of running [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge)
and only needs network access to the device or program in question. There is no need to
run this on the same machine as iTunes.

This plugin provides volume control and play/pause controls via HomeKit. These can be
used in conjunction with the [homebridge-callmonitor plugin](https://github.com/grover/homebridge-callmonitor)
to pause media playback or to reduce the playback volume while on a phone call.

The Speaker service, which provides volume control and mute, can be disabled if it is not
required - for example if the Apple TV is connected to an A/V receiver that is integrated with HomeKit via a different plugin.

## Installation instructions

After [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) has been installed:

 ```sudo npm install -g homebridge-dacp```

## Example config.json

```json
{
  "bridge": {
      ...
  },
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "DACP",
      "devices": [
        {
          "name": "Apple TV (Living room)",
          "pairing": "...pairing code...",
          "serviceName": "...service name...",
        },
        {
          "name": "iTunes on iMac",
          "pairing": "...pairing code...",
          "serviceName": "...service name..."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The platform can connect to any number of devices or programs at the same time as long as they support the DACP protocol. I've tested the plugin with an Apple TV 4 and iTunes 12.7.

You may choose to create all accessories with one remote or create multiple remotes and group your
accessories in a way that suits you best.

The plugin is configured with the following configuration:

| Attributes | Usage |
|------------|-------|
| name | The name of the accessory and remote control to create for this device. |
| pairing | The pairing code for the device, which is created during the pairing process. |
| serviceName | The service name obtained during the pairing process. |
| features | An object that enables you to restrict the services created for this accessory. |
| no-volume-control | Disables the Speaker service for Apple TVs, which perform volume control through external devices like a TV or A/V receiver. |

## Accessory Services

Each device will expose multiple services:

* Accessory Information Service
* Speaker Service
* [Player Controls Service](src/hap/PlayerControlsTypes.js)
* [Now Playing Service](src/hap/NowPlayingTypes.js)

### Player Controls Service

## Supported clients

This platform and the devices it controls have been verified to work with the following apps on iOS 11

* Elgato Eve

## Supported devices and programs

* Apple TV 4

Other devices not listed here may work. If you have another device that works, please report
it via a [GitHub](https://github.com/grover/homebridge-dacp/issues) issue.

### Pairing

The remote control created by this plugin needs to be paired to the devices you want to use. The pairing process varies by device or program
and the following screenshots illustrate the pairing process.
